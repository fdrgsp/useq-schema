    """A sequence of MDA (Multi-Dimensional Acquisition) events.

    This is the core object in the `useq` library, and is used define a sequence of
    events to be run on a microscope. It object may be constructed manually, or from
    file (e.g. json or yaml).

    The object itself acts as an iterator for [`useq.MDAEvent`][] objects:

    Attributes
    ----------
    metadata : dict
        A dictionary of user metadata to be stored with the sequence.
    axis_order : str
        The order of the axes in the sequence. Must be a permutation of `"tpgcz"`. The
        default is `"tpgcz"`.
    stage_positions : tuple[Position, ...]
        The stage positions to visit. (each with `x`, `y`, `z`, `name`, and `sequence`,
        all of which are optional).
    grid_plan : GridFromEdges, GridRelative, NoGrid
        The grid plan to follow. One of `GridFromEdges`, `GridRelative` or `NoGrid`.
    channels : tuple[Channel, ...]
        The channels to acquire. see `Channel`.
    time_plan : MultiPhaseTimePlan | TIntervalDuration | TIntervalLoops \
        | TDurationLoops | NoT
        The time plan to follow. One of `TIntervalDuration`, `TIntervalLoops`,
        `TDurationLoops`, `MultiPhaseTimePlan`, or `NoT`
    z_plan : ZTopBottom | ZRangeAround | ZAboveBelow | ZRelativePositions | \
        ZAbsolutePositions | NoZ
        The z plan to follow. One of `ZTopBottom`, `ZRangeAround`, `ZAboveBelow`,
        `ZRelativePositions`, `ZAbsolutePositions`, or `NoZ`.
    uid : UUID
        A read-only unique identifier (uuid version 4) for the sequence. This will be
        generated, do not set.
    autofocus_plan : AxesBasedAF | NoAF
        The hardware autofocus plan to follow. One of `AxesBasedAF` or `NoAF`.
